                    Combining skills makes you unique. Let me use a sports reference for example. Lebron James, who is a physical force at 6’8 and 250 pounds can not only score at will, he can also pass.

                    This allows him to be a unique talent. This is what I’m trying to be in my career. I know it’s hard to be great at one thing, but it’s possible to be good at multiple skill sets. My focus is to be great at coding while having a solid understanding at marketing.

                    I prefer to be the one building because it gives me more satisfaction by making something people find useful. But knowing coding and marketing allows me to know how to build and sell. Being able to do both makes me a valuable part of a team.

                <div className="post-container">
                    Knowing both skills lets me communicate with both the sales and engineering team. I’ll understand the lingo of engineers and be able to decipher that and communicate it with sales. Doing this makes me a liaison of some sorts. I can interpret and send messages between teams.

                    The second reason I wanted to learn coding and use it with my marketing skills is to create software. The power of software is all around us. All we need to do to realize this is by using our phones.

                <div className="post-container">
                    For websites, I can create software to help me identify which websites are getting traffic and which aren't. 
                    Or, I can create chatbots to help customers troubleshoot.

                    <br/>
                    My main focus for now and the long-term is coding though. Not only do I get more fulfillment by building something with my own hands, coding is just more interesting to me in general.

                    Compared to my experience in accounting and marketing, coding gives me the ability to get into flow state which is priceless. I enjoy activities which I'm good at and
                    flow state is the fastest way for me to get good.
